# **Project 9: Jack Programming Language Interactive Program**

We are developing an interactive program using the Jack programming language, a simple, Java-like, object-based language. This project focuses on becoming familiar with Jack for future tasks, including building a Jack compiler (Projects 10 and 11) and a basic operating system (Project 12). Additionally, it introduces the fundamentals of creating programs that combine graphics, animation, and user interaction.

---

## **Objective**
Our objective is to:
- Write an interactive program in Jack.
- Explore the capabilities of the Jack language and its OS.
- Gain hands-on experience with graphics, animation, and user interaction.

> **Note:** The project is currently in progress. We have laid the foundation and are working towards completing the program soon.

## **How to Use**
1. **Create Your Program Folder**  
   Store your Jack program files (`.jack`) in a dedicated folder.

2. **Compile the Program**  
   Use the Jack Compiler to compile all `.jack` files in the folder into `.vm` files.

3. **Run the Program**  
   Load the compiled `.vm` files into the [VM Emulator](https://nand2tetris.github.io/web-ide/vm) and run the program. Debug as needed.

---

## **Key Features**
- **Jack Language Proficiency:**  
  Developed a Jack-based interactive application that combines logic, graphics, and user interaction.
- **Graphics and Animation:**  
  Utilized the Jack OS to render graphics and manage animations efficiently.
- **User Interaction:**  
  Designed user-friendly controls and interactions within the application.

> **Note:** The features above represent our planned objectives and progress. Some are partially implemented and will be completed as we continue working on the project :)

## **Resources**
- [Jack Compiler](https://nand2tetris.github.io/web-ide/compiler): For translating Jack programs into `.vm` files.
- [VM Emulator](https://nand2tetris.github.io/web-ide/vm): For running and debugging the compiled code.
- [Nand2Tetris Course](https://www.nand2tetris.org/): Comprehensive course resources.
- [Bitmap Editor](https://github.com/nand2tetris/BitmapEditor): For designing and rendering custom graphics.

## **Future Work**
This project is a work in progress, and we are actively working towards:
- Completing the programâ€™s planned features and ensuring functionality.
- Using the program as a foundation for:
  - **Projects 10 and 11:** Writing a Jack compiler.
  - **Project 12:** Developing a basic operating system in Jack.
